# FREEFOODAPP

## Introduction

Students all around campus have a very similar issue. If you are a sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate student, food is always an important part of the day. But, the majority of students on campus do not have a meal plan. This requires students to either bring food to campus or to buy food on campus with their own money. Furthermore, preparing breakfast, lunch, or dinner requires ample amounts of time during the day that many students simply do not have due to their large course load, homework, work, and clubs. This causes the issue that many students simply skip eating food due to the cost and time, or students spending exuberant amounts of money on food. 

One of the best parts about being on a college campus, however, is the fact that there is almost always free food somewhere during the day. The food usually comes from events, classes, departments, samples, and other events on campus throughout the term. The problem with free food is that most of the time it is difficult to communicate when and where free food exists, as it can happen randomly. 

Our goal for our app is to provide a place where students and staff can post about free food to the greater community in an easy to use, responsive, and accurate app. Moreover, the app should be able to allow users to post to a public feed the details of the food, a photo, and location, and allow other users to “upvote” posts that are accurate and good, and to allow users to say when the food is gone/not accurate.
